# Summary Processing Chain

A **processing chain** is like a special assembly line where different helper toys work together to solve a problem.

## What is a Processing Chain?

A processing chain is a way to break down a big, complicated task into smaller, easier steps. Think of it like making a sandwich:
- First, you get the bread (input)
- Then you add butter (first step)
- Next, you put cheese (second step)
- Finally, you add some yummy toppings (final output)

## How Does a Processing Chain Work?

In LangChain, a processing chain connects different **magical helpers**:
- **Prompt Template**: Tells the computer what to do
- **Language Model**: The brain that thinks and creates answers
- **Output Parser**: Helps make the answer neat and tidy

## Simple Example

```python
# Imagine telling the computer: "Help me name a company that makes sheets!"
chain = prompt | llm | output_parser
result = chain.invoke({"product": "Queen Size Sheet Set"})
```

The chain takes your input, thinks about a cool company name, and gives you an answer - just like magic! ðŸª„

Each **link** in the chain does a small job, and together they solve big problems easily and smoothly.
