# A Simple Summary Processing Chain

A **processing chain** is like a special assembly line where different helper toys work together to solve a problem.

## What is a Processing Chain?

A processing chain is a way to break down a big, complicated task into smaller, easier steps. Think of it like making a sandwich:
- First, you get the bread (input)
- Then you add butter (first step)
- Next, you put cheese (second step)
- Finally, you add some yummy toppings (final output)

## How Does a Processing Chain Work?

In LangChain, a processing chain connects different **magical helpers**:
- **Prompt Template**: Tells the computer what to do
- **Language Model**: The brain that thinks and creates answers
- **Output Parser**: Helps make the answer neat and tidy

## Simple Example

```python
# Imagine telling the computer: "Help me name a company that makes sheets!"
chain = prompt | llm | output_parser
result = chain.invoke({"product": "Queen Size Sheet Set"})
```

The chain takes your input, thinks about a cool company name, and gives you an answer - just like magic! ðŸª„

Each **link** in the chain does a small job, and together they solve big problems easily and smoothly.

# Crafting an Open-Source Text Summarizer with LangChain and Critical Vectors

In todayâ€™s digital landscape, where information is abundant and attention spans are short, the ability to distill lengthy texts into concise summaries is more valuable than ever. Whether you're a researcher sifting through academic papers, a professional managing extensive reports, or simply someone who wants to stay informed without getting bogged down by details, an efficient text summarizer can be a game-changer. Letâ€™s explore how you can build a robust, open-source text summarizer using **LangChain**, **Critical Vectors**, and Python's multiprocessing capabilities.

### Versatile Summarization Strategies

`TextSummAI` offers multiple strategies to suit different needs:

- **Map-Reduce**: Splits the text, summarizes each chunk (optionally in parallel), and combines the results.
- **None**: Summarizes the entire text in one go without chunking.
- **Critical Vectors**: Selects the most relevant chunks using clustering before summarization.

This flexibility ensures that you can adapt the summarizer to various types of texts and requirements.

```python
class TextSummAI:
    def __init__(self, strategy='map_reduce', parallelization=True):
        # Initialization code...
        pass
    
    def summarize_text(self, text, chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0):
        if self.strategy == 'map_reduce':
            # Map-Reduce strategy
            pass
        elif self.strategy == 'none':
            # No chunking
            pass
        elif self.strategy == 'critical_vectors':
            # Critical Vectors strategy
            pass
```

## A Seamless and Open Approach

One of the standout features of this setup is its open nature. By leveraging open-source libraries like LangChain and Critical Vectors, youâ€™re not tied to any specific vendor. This ensures that your summarizer remains flexible, customizable, and free from vendor lock-in, allowing you to switch out components or integrate new ones as your needs evolve.
